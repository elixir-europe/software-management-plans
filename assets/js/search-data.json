      "content": "We identified two main stakeholders’ groups corresponding to users and adopters. In addition, we defined a group of distinguished personas that are out of the scope of the SMP’s stakeholders, specifically the (a) software users who might also be contributors (e.g. by submitting bugs), and (b) the end-users of the software, who have no involvement with the software development process. For each group of identified stakeholders we answered two questions: . (i) how the stakeholders would use the SMP. (ii) at which stage of the software development the stakeholders would need the SMP most. Group 1: Users / Benefiter / Enforcers . This group includes stakeholders that require access to the SMP for a given software, but are not responsible for filling it in. Funders e.g ELIXIR, Wellcome Trust Policy Makers e.g. European Commission (can use SMPs as a way of “enforcing” their recommendations and policies) Service providers (e.g. Compute Platform, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS use an SMP in order to ensure compatibility to the infrastructure offered) Software manager not necessarily contributing to the software - making sure principles are enforced Publishers e.g. F1000 should use an SMP in order to ensure software “quality” / availability?) . Group 2: Adopters . This group includes stakeholders that are primarily responsible for filling a SMP for a given software. Developer/Researcher the person writing the software needs to be aware of the basic principles to follow PI of a group can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices) Organisation (Fundee) Vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable - select appropriate SMP. This is the instance where an Institution is attempting to create a policy for internal use (ensure that any “badged” research software produced under it, aligns to the expectations of the selected SMP) .

We use GitHub to submit and keep track of questions, requests, and suggestions regarding the ELIXIR SMP. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub issues, here is an excellent guide. When opening an issue in the GitHub repository, please follow these steps: . Check that your point or request is not being addressed in a previous open issue. Open a new issue explaining your point or request. Use the appropriate label in your issue. We provide a set of labels that designate the different questions in the ELIXIR SMP. Label your issue with the related question. Add as many labels as needed if your issue relates to multiple questions. If your issue does not relate specifically to any question, do not add any label. Note that GitHub issues can be labeled either at the moment of its creation or at any moment afterward. Your issue will be reviewed during the upcoming maintainers’ quarterly meetings, depending on its priority (see “Editorial Process” section). If your point has already been covered in an issue, we encourage you to participate in the discussion by adding your view in a comment on the issue. During the prioritization process, those issues with active discussions will be tackled first during the editorial process. If you want to participate in the editorial process: . Join the dedicated mailing list of the SMP group RO Crate community -&gt; open an issue with a specific message that they want to join the community Shared calendar with the invites? . Follow the CoC (copy contributions guidelines from somewhere) . ",

      "content": "Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone of good data management and are now considered a key element of Open Science practices. A DMP describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected, processed and/or generated within the lifetime of a particular project or activity. Conversely, a Software Management Plan (SMP) can help formalise a set of structures and goals that ensure the software is accessible and reusable in the short, medium and long term. Although it has a management perspective, the main advantage of an SMP is that it provides clear context to the software that is being developed. In that sense, it addresses several aspects of the software development process such as (a) supporting reproducibility and reusability of the software, (b) allowing funding agencies to have a better grasp of the envisioned development process (as well as the achieved milestones), (c) increasing the awareness of the existing community standards that can/should be used, and (d) ensuring that the software can be easily accessed by the wider community. There are a few flavours of SMPs already available in one form or another. The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) offers a very detailed checklist that is further complemented by an online sustainability evaluation service (SES). Several journals (such as SoftwareX and the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)) have checklists that are expected to be filled in by the software authors before any submissions addressing most of the key points of an SMP. Finally, there are funding agencies (such as the Wellcome Trust) that expect a plan for the management of research output, including software, in submitted applications. A key downside of the aforementioned SMPs is that they tend to be rather complex, occasionally requiring deep technical knowledge of the software development process. In order to address these drawbacks, ELIXIR has designed a simplified version of an SMP, tailored for Life Science oriented projects but still general enough so as to be widely used. The primary goal of the ELIXIR SMP is to encourage wider adoption by Life Science researchers, and be as inclusive as possible to the various levels of technical expertise, while also having an explicit connection to the FAIR principles for Research Software. A common theme in Life Science researchers is the wide differences in background expertise, with the vast majority of researchers being self-taught research software developers. Having an SMP with a relatively low barrier in technical knowledge, while maintaining all the best practices expected in research software development, may both encourage wider adoption of these practices as well as increase the awareness of the multiple aspects involved in research software development. The overall process that led to the creation of the ELIXIR Software Management Plan can be found in the ELIXIR Software Management Plan for the Life Sciences BioHackrxiv preprint. ",
