These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers. ELIXIR coordinates, integrates and sustains these resources so that they form a single infrastructure. This infrastructure makes it easier for scientists to find and share data, exchange expertise, and agree on best practices. Learn more at elixir-europe.org. ",

      "content": "We identified two main stakeholders’ groups corresponding to users and adopters. In addition, we defined a group of distinguished personas that are out of the scope of the SMP’s stakeholders, specifically the (a) software users who might also be contributors (e.g. by submitting bugs), and (b) the end-users of the software, who have no involvement with the software development process. For each group of identified stakeholders we answered two questions: . (i) how the stakeholders would use the SMP. (ii) at which stage of the software development the stakeholders would need the SMP most. Group 1: Users / Benefiter / Enforcers . This group includes stakeholders that require access to the SMP for a given software, but are not responsible for filling it in. Funders e.g ELIXIR, Wellcome Trust Policy Makers e.g. European Commission (can use SMPs as a way of “enforcing” their recommendations and policies) Service providers (e.g. Compute Platform, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS use an SMP in order to ensure compatibility to the infrastructure offered) Software manager not necessarily contributing to the software - making sure principles are enforced Publishers e.g. F1000 should use an SMP in order to ensure software “quality” / availability?) . Group 2: Adopters . This group includes stakeholders that are primarily responsible for filling a SMP for a given software. Developer/Researcher the person writing the software needs to be aware of the basic principles to follow PI of a group can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices) Organisation (Fundee) Vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable - select appropriate SMP. This is the instance where an Institution is attempting to create a policy for internal use (ensure that any “badged” research software produced under it, aligns to the expectations of the selected SMP) .

We use GitHub to submit and keep track of questions, requests, and suggestions regarding the ELIXIR SMP. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub issues, here is an excellent guide. When opening an issue in the GitHub repository, please follow these steps: . Check that your point or request is not being addressed in a previous open issue. Open a new issue explaining your point or request. Use the appropriate label in your issue. We provide a set of labels that designate the different questions in the ELIXIR SMP. Label your issue with the related question. Add as many labels as needed if your issue relates to multiple questions. If your issue does not relate specifically to any question, do not add any label. Note that GitHub issues can be labeled either at the moment of its creation or at any moment afterward. Your issue will be reviewed during the upcoming maintainers’ quarterly meetings, depending on its priority (see “Editorial Process” section). If your point has already been covered in an issue, we encourage you to participate in the discussion by adding your view in a comment on the issue. During the prioritization process, those issues with active discussions will be tackled first during the editorial process. If you want to participate in the editorial process: . Join the dedicated mailing list of the SMP group RO Crate community -&gt; open an issue with a specific message that they want to join the community Shared calendar with the invites? . Follow the CoC (copy contributions guidelines from somewhere) . ",
