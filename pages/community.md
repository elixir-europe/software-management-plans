## SMP stakeholders

We identified two main stakeholders’ groups corresponding to users and adopters. In addition, we defined a group of distinguished personas that are out of the scope of the SMP’s stakeholders, specifically the (a) **software users** who might also be contributors (e.g. by submitting bugs), and (b) the **end-users** of the software, who have no involvement with the software development process.

For each group of identified stakeholders we answered two questions: 

- (i) how the stakeholders would use the SMP.
- (ii) at which stage of the software development the stakeholders would need the SMP most.

### Group 1: Users / Benefiter / Enforcers

This group includes stakeholders that require access to the SMP for a given software, but are not responsible for filling it in.

- **Funders** e.g ELIXIR, Wellcome Trust
- **Policy Makers** e.g. European Commission (can use SMPs as a way of "enforcing" their recommendations and policies)
- **Service providers** (e.g. Compute Platform, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS use an SMP in order to ensure compatibility to the infrastructure offered)
- **Software manager** not necessarily contributing to the software - making sure principles are enforced
- **Publishers** e.g. [F1000](https://f1000research.com/) should use an SMP in order to ensure software "quality" / availability?)


### Group 2: Adopters

This group includes stakeholders that are primarily responsible for filling a SMP for a given software.

- **Developer/Researcher** the person writing the software needs to be aware of the basic principles to follow
- **PI of a group** can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices)
- **Organisation (Fundee)** Vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable - select appropriate SMP. This is the instance where an Institution is attempting to create a policy for internal use (ensure that any “badged” research software produced under it, aligns to the expectations of the selected SMP)
