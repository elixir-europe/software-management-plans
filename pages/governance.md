## How the ELIXIR SMP is maintained

The ELIXIR SMP is updated by incorporating the community feedback, which is done through an open editorial process (see maintenance below). You don’t need to be part of ELIXIR in order to provide your feedback and to contribute.

All questions listed in this page above are the latest version, including the templates provided. All old versions are available directly through the Github repository.


## Maintenance

### Maintainers group

- **Chair**: person with the ELIXIR Lead role (Eva)
- **Co-chair**: another person
- **Members**: -> Manthos Pitoulias (Elixir Hub)

### Editorial Process

The maintainers group meets online on a quarterly basis, with the details (date, time and connection details) announced through the mailing list at least 3 weeks in advance.

Before this call, all issues raised in the GitHub repository will be prioritised by the maintainers group with regards to impact and severity.

During this call, all issues will be discussed in order of priority, and based on the discussion and consensus by all TC participants, they will be tagged as “to be integrated”, “further discussion necessary”, or closed if assessed by the group as not applicable/suitable/relevant/duplicated/etc <polite way of saying “not useful/relevant”>.

After the first and third quarterly call of the year, all “to be integrated changes” to the ELIXIR SMP questions will be added to the questions, in order to create a new release/version of the ELIXIR SMP.


## How to contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. You can participate in the following ways: 

- We use GitHub to submit and keep track of questions, requests, and suggestions regarding the ELIXIR SMP. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub issues, [here is an excellent guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart). When opening an issue in the GitHub repository, please follow these steps:

  1. Check that your point or request is not being addressed in a previous open issue.  
  2. Open a new issue explaining your point or request. 
  3. Use the appropriate label in your issue. We provide a set of labels that designate the different questions in the ELIXIR SMP. Label your issue with the related question. Add as many labels as needed if your issue relates to multiple questions. If your issue does not relate specifically to any question, do not add any label. Note that GitHub issues can be labeled either at the moment of its creation or at any moment afterward. 
  4. Your issue will be reviewed during the upcoming maintainers’ quarterly meetings, depending on its priority (see “Editorial Process” section). 
	
	If your point has already been covered in an issue, we encourage you to participate in the discussion by adding your view in a comment on the issue. During the prioritization process, those issues with active discussions will be tackled first during the editorial process.  

- If you want to participate in the editorial process: 
    - Join the dedicated mailing list of the SMP group 
    - RO Crate community -> open an issue with a specific message that they want to join the community 
    - Shared calendar with the invites? 

Follow the CoC (copy contributions guidelines from somewhere)
