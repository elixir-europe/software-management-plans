### Sections of the ELIXIR SMP 

The ELIXIR SMP consists in 21 questions organized in the following chapters:

- Accessibility / License 
- Documentation 
- Testing 
- Interoperability
- Versioning 
- Reproducibility 
- Recognition


### Stages of the Software Lifecycle in the ELIXIR SMP 

The different questions are usually relevant in different stages of the software development lifecycle. The ELIXIR SMP currently supports questions for the following stages:

- **Stage 1: Getting Started** – Requirements, specifications, and planning. 
- **Stage 2: Construction** – Prototyping and implementing core functionality. 
- **Stage 3: Application** – Releasing and assessing quality. 
- **Stage 4: Production** – Running the software on real-world data in a stable manner. 
- **Stage 5: Publication** – Publishing the software and research results. 


### Considerations 

- This refers to the ELIXIR SMP version 1.0.0 (date 25/10/2021).
- You can dive deeper into the ELIXIR SMP in the original [ELIXIR SMP preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv/k8znb_v1).
- You can use the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://smw.dsw.elixir-europe.org) to fill in this questions through a user-friendly interface.
- The ELIXIR Software Management Plan focuses on the development of research software rather than what happens to it in the long term.
