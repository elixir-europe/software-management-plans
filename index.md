# Governance of the ELIXIR SMP

## How the ELIXIR SMP is maintained

The ELIXIR SMP is updated by incorporating the community feedback, which is done through an open editorial process (see maintenance below). You don’t need to be part of ELIXIR in order to provide your feedback and to contribute.

All questions listed in this page above are the latest version, including the templates provided. All old versions are available directly through the Github repository.


## Maintenance

### Maintainers group

Chair: person with the ELIXIR Lead role (Eva)
Co-chair: another person
Members: -> to add our names and affiliations, not emails/contact details

### Editorial Process

The maintainers group meets online on a quarterly basis, with the details (date, time and connection details) announced through the mailing list at least 3 weeks in advance.

Before this call, all issues raised in the GitHub repository will be prioritised by the maintainers group with regards to impact and severity.

During this call, all issues will be discussed in order of priority, and based on the discussion and consensus by all TC participants, they will be tagged as “to be integrated”, “further discussion necessary”, or closed if assessed by the group as not applicable/suitable/relevant/duplicated/etc <polite way of saying “not useful/relevant”>.

After the first and third quarterly call of the year, all “to be integrated changes” to the ELIXIR SMP questions will be added to the questions, in order to create a new release/version of the ELIXIR SMP.


## How to contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. You can participate in the following ways:
Open an issue in the GitHub repo, following the rules and guidelines listed.

In order to contribute to a GitHub issue, we expect all contributors to make use of the provided tags, and ensure (as much as feasible) that there are no other conflicting discussions.

Each tag corresponds to a different question.
